The nation has made major efforts in conservation to address these issues. Many species, including the Asian elephant, the Sri Lankan leopard, and many bird species, depend on national parks like Wilpattu, Udawalawe, and Yala as their home. Anti-poaching patrols, habitat restoration initiatives, and community engagement programmes are examples of conservation initiatives in these parks that work to foster wildlife coexistence with nearby communities. In addition, Sri Lanka has put programmes and policies in place to safeguard endangered species. Wildlife corridors were created across the nation to help animals move between dispersed habitats, thereby lowering isolation and increasing genetic diversity."

The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No. 2 of 1937 grants legal protection to each and every species. Protected Areas serve as a network for the protection of habitats and the biodiversity they support. The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and the Provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) are used to regulate the international trade of wild species.\n\nSri Lanka's protected areas are essential to the preservation of biodiversity. Certain species are becoming threatened due to the shrinking and disappearance of their habitats brought about by urbanisation, development projects, and the country's fastest population growth. In the protected areas, human intervention is either strictly forbidden or restricted. As a result, these places serve as havens for various species, offering the perfect environment to guarantee their survival. Ecosystem services and places of cultural and historical significance are safeguarded by protected areas."

Yala has a craggy coastline, as well as dry grasslands, arid scrubland, and isolated areas of jungle.

This loss of habitat causes habitat to be reduced and fragmented, resulting in conflicts between humans and wildlife, prey loss, declining populations, and ecosystem imbalances that endanger the survival of the species and call for conservation measures.\n\nThe Department of Wildlife Conservation is in favour of declaring 2021 as Sri Lanka Leopard Day.

The fieldwork for the project started in 2022, and surveys and camera traps will be used to monitor leopards.\n\nThe research centres will foster networking among regional forest and wildlife officers and act as focal points for education to raise local awareness. Knowledge will be shared and research-based strategies for mitigating human-leopard conflicts will be developed."
